# Spring: Framework in Depth

This is the final exercise for the LinkedIn course [**Spring: Framework in Depth**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/spring-framework-in-depth-2/) 

The task is to write your own Aspect, to create a counter to count all method calls, so all calls to an individual method.\
It has to report on them by method name and then apply the counter at method level, and you can apply it to any number of methods you want.\
It must count each time the method is called in the application and then continually output that every time it's called, in the format:\
*&lt;method name> : <number of times it's been called>*
